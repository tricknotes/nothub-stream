[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tricknotes/nothub-stream.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tricknotes/nothub-stream)

NotHub Stream is a Server of [NotHub](http://nothub.org)

## Setup

``` sh
$ git clone git://github.com/tricknotes/nothub-stream.git ./nothub-stream
$ cd nothub-stream
$ npm install .
```

Edit config:

``` sh
$ cp ./config/stream.config.example ./config/stream.config
```

Write your setting to `./config/stream.config`.

And run:

``` sh
$ npm start
```

## Test

You can use github authorization, to use advansed rate limit.
- http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/

Run using `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` as an environment variable:

``` sh
$ GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="Your API Token" npm start
```

## Using on github:enterprise

You can use `nothub` on [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) perhaps.
(I have no testing environments. Sorry:-))

1. Install `nothub` as a node module:
``` sh
$ mkdir your_project
$ cd your_project
$ npm install https://github.com/tricknotes/nothub-stream
```

2. Copy script for running nothub:
``` sh
$ cp ./node_modules/nothub-stream/start.js ./start.js
```

3. And edit `./start.js` to use dommain name for your github:enterprise.
For example:
``` diff
- var NotHubStream = require('./')
+ var NotHubStream = require('nothub-stream')
```
``` diff
  crawler = new Crawler({
    query: {
      access_token: process.env['GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN']
+     host: 'yourdomain.com'
    }
  });
```
